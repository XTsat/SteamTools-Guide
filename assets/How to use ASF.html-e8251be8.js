Our ASF-ui IPC interface also supports configuring ASF and is particularly suitable for modifying configuration content after the first configuration, because unlike the online configuration file generator that always generates new files, ASF-ui can edit configuration files directly in-place.

To use ASF-ui, you first need to enable the IPC interface itself. Since ASF version V5.1.0.0, IPC is enabled by default, so you can start accessing it directly as long as you have not manually disabled it.

After the program starts, the ASF's IPC address is accessed directly. If everything is working properly, you can also change the ASF configuration here. `),g,S,e("p",null,[t("As mentioned above, ASF-ui is a community project and is not maintained by the core ASF developers.
